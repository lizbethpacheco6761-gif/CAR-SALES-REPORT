# CAR-SALES-REPORT
I currently work on the accounting side of a dealership, one specific brand too.  I think it'll be interesting to see the sales of other car brands too!

Here is the link of the dataset from Kaggle.

**Dataset Overview**
This dataset was found on the Kaggle website, "Car Sales Report".  It shows 23,906 different vehicle transactions and includes information about the vehicles themselves & customer demographics.  For the vehicles, it shows the ID, make, model, color, engine, transmmission, body style, amd the price.  For the customer info they included the name, gender, and phone number. It also includes the dealership name & the region where they are located.


**Started the Analysis**
To start the analysis, I made an introduction to have readers understand the dataset & why I chose it.  Since I do work at a dealership, I want to see other vehicle transactions from around the country.
I imported all the libraries necessary to perform the analysis.  I imported the dataset and displayed the top rows just to get an overview of what I would be working with
